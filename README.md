# USSDSpace

USSDSpace is a proof of concept application that allows a non technical user to define USSD menus and actions using
a GUI interface and deploy these menus to a Java based server for interfacing to a cellular service providers USSD service
I have yet to see an application that allows this, although there may be one out there. This was initially written in Swift 2.3 and makes heavy use of CoreAnimation and Cocoa.
